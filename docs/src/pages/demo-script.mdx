description: An innovative vaccine delivery supply chain solution
---


IBM research, MIT Data Science Lab and pharmaceutical companies use machine learning models to identify potential hotspots with granular location precision for making informed the supply chain decisions. This requires trust and transparency in AI before triggering any changes to their supply chain execution. 

The diagram below is a minimum viable product solution design

We will now highlight features and functions of the solution:

As shown in the component view above, a potential hotspot is detected in Miami, this triggers the creation of orders in the Vaccine Order Portal. The vaccine order stipulates the amount of vaccines to be delivered to any place in the world, with varying level of criticality and delivery timeframe. This triggers the [Order and Reefer optimization](./design/voro/) service that invokes a series of complex optimization planning:

* To optimize the most cost effective vaccine sourcing and shipping routes to meet the demand subjected to the availability of both vaccines and refrigerator containers. 
* To optimize the flow of vaccine refrigerator containers including repositioning of the empty containers to support the optimal fulfillment plans
 
Furthermore, given the dynamic nature of the situation, the plans need to be continuously optimized with the latest information. 

A vaccine typically travels through multiple sites before being ready for shipment. Multiple companies are involved to manufacture the vaccines. Vaccines need to be handled at an optimal cool temperature (36-46 degrees F) and managed through the cold chain process. For high-value items like vaccines, clinical trial samples and lifesaving medications,  a fluctuation as minor as 2 degrees Celsius can reduce or even eliminate effectiveness, the stakes couldn't be higher. 

As the shipment of vaccines is underway, cold chain monitoring service monitors the performance of the cold chain in real time. This is supported by two components: 

* a real time stateful operator connected to the event streams coming as reefer telemetries: The refrigerated containers, those would be used to ship the Vaccines to the Medical facilities, need monitoring. That is to ensure that all sensors within the containers are working properly so that its internal control system maintains  the necessary temperature and the concentration of cryogenic fluids. Otherwise the Vaccines would be spoiled and cannot be used for the treatment of patients. The data of various sensors from the containers (while they are on job to fulfill a shipment) can be continuously captured as [event data and kept in any kind of datastore](./solution/cold-monitoring/). 
* an anomaly detection scoring model developed, deployed and monitored using Watson capabilities within [Cloud Pak for Data](./solution/cp4d/). Like any other Cloud Pak, Cloud Pak for Data can also run in any Cloud infrastructure - IBM Cloud, Azure, Google or Amazon or even in On Premise infrastructure.

The telemetry can be used to build a AI model to continuously check if any irregularity happening in the Containers while in move (which can in turn spoil the Vaccines).

Once we have detected the anomaly, a process is triggered in conjunction with blockchain Ledger to remove the bad batch of vaccines from the supply chain. The maintenance business process uses IBM cloud pak for automation. 

The blockchain component is key, in this solution, to ensure continuous transparency between the different business partners involved in this end to end manufacturing and delivery of the vaccine lots.  By this time many counterfeit vaccines exist in the market. The physician at the point of inoculation uses IBM’s Research led innovation - IBM’s Crypto Anchor Verifier. After scanning the vaccine, the Verifier records its unique wavelength and microscopic details on the blockchain; verifying its authenticity against the original digital fingerprint captured at source; all in a matter of sub seconds.
