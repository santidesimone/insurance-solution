Our Continuous Deployment (CD) approach focuses on a GitOps-based deployment model, using Git as a single source of truth for the deployment, management, and operations of our running application components. In this model, we have the flexibility to use multiple open-source to apply the single source of truth from a given Git repository onto a desired cluster environment. More detail around the background of GitOps and how it differs from traditional deployment models can be found in [this blog post](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) from WeaveWorks.

One of the main DevOps tool which provides the opportunity to deployment applications via the GitOps methodology is [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/). The Tekton Pipelines project provides a declarative language for defining and executing both CI and CD-style pipelines, all defined with common Kubernetes-like nomenclature. It even has the capability to kick off pipeline runs based off of GitHub webhooks. The details of our Tekton & Appsody deployments are covered in the [Tekton & Appsody deployments](#tekton-appsody-deployments) section below.

## Tekton & Appsody deployments

We have also implemented some facets of the project deployment workflows using the [Tekton Pipelines](https://tekton.dev/) project and its inherent ease of support of the [Appsody](https://appsody.dev/) open-source developer experience project through the standard integration between the two built into the [IBM Cloud Pak for Applications](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-applications).

Defined in the [/scripts/tekton](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-reefer-ml/tree/master/scripts/tekton) directory, we have a simple pipeline that will utilize the `appsody deploy` command to deploy the generated AppsodyApplication CRD YAML to the target environment. Similar to our ArgoCD-based deployments of Helm-generated, standard Kubernetes YAMLs, AppsodyApplication YAMLs can also be deployed through ArgoCD in a GitOps manner. However, for demonstration inside this project, additional capabilities are provided to showcase how we can utilize different pieces of the platform to deploy similar applications when different requirements are presented. Similar to ArgoCD, Tekton Pipelines run on the same cluster _(and often in the same namespace!)_ as your running application code, thus allowing for more programmatic control over the deployment, management, operations, and existence of your application components.

The key artifact that enables Tekton to deploy our Appsody-based `refarch-reefer-ml/simulator` microservice is the generated `app-deploy.yaml` file. The [refarch-reefer-ml/simulator/app-deploy.yaml](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-reefer-ml/blob/master/simulator/app-deploy.yaml) file was generated according to the `appsody build` command and then annotated with the required environment variables and metadata for successful operation in a given namespace, very similar to the pattern required for generating our Helm-templated YAMLs in the [ArgoCD deployments](#argocd-deployments) section above.

We then make use of the [Appsody Operator](https://appsody.dev/docs/using-appsody/building-and-deploying#deployment-via-the-appsody-operator---overview) to apply the AppsodyApplication to the target environment through the `appsody deploy --no-build` command. As documented in the [Appsody Docs](https://appsody.dev/docs/using-appsody/building-and-deploying#deploying-your-application-through-docker-hub), we are able to take advantage of the pre-built container images available on Docker Hub and the annotated `app-deploy.yaml` file that is now a synonymous GitOps-like deployment artifact to quickly apply the change to the target namespace in the same cluster. Once the `appsody deploy` command is succesful, the Appsody Operator and Kubernetes takes care of the rest and reconciles the necessary underlying Kubernetes artifacts that are required to fulfill the requirements of serving up the application code in real-time!

### Deploying the simulator microservice with Tekton & Appsody

#### Prerequisites

1. Ensure all necessary Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets have been created in the namespace in which the application will be running.
2. Ensure an [Appsody Operator](https://appsody.dev/docs/using-appsody/building-and-deploying#deployment-via-the-appsody-operator---overview) has been configured to watch the namespace in which the application will be running.
3. Create a new or modify an existing Service Account in the target namespace and bind the required API RBAC requirements for the Appsody Operator.
    * Further details available in the [Appsody Docs](https://appsody.dev/docs/using-appsody/building-and-deploying#rbac-considerations-for-the-use-of-appsody-deploy-and-appsody-operator-commands)
    * A sample YAML document has been provided via [rbac-sa.yaml](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-reefer-ml/blob/master/scripts/tekton/rbac-sa.yaml), with environment-specific updates to the Namespace and Service Account name fields being required.
3. From the `refarch-reefer-ml` directory, import the Tekton pipeline artifacts:
```shell
kubectl apply -f scripts/tekton/
```
4. Validate these items have been imported successfully by querying the cluster:
```shell
kubectl get Pipeline,Task,PipelineResource
```

#### Using the command-line interface

1. Open the `/scripts/tekton/manual/simulator-pipeline-run.yaml` file in a text editor and ensure everything makes sense.
2. Kick off a new pipeline run with the Kubernetes CLI:
```shell
kubectl create -f scripts/tekton/manual/simulator-pipeline-run.yaml
```
3. You can monitor the pipeline by common `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe` commands:
```shell
kubectl get PipelineRun
```
For further details on how to access the logs of a PipelineRun, reference the [Tekton Pipelines documentation](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/v0.9.2/docs/logs.md).
4. Once the pipeline completes, you should see a deployed instance of the Simulator Appsody application:
```shell
kubectl get Pods
```

#### Using the Tekton dashboard

1. Access the Tekton Pipelines dashboard from your Kabanero installation or directly via the defined Route. This will be something similar to [https://tekton-dashboard-tekton-pipelines.apps.green.ocp.csplab.local](https://tekton-dashboard-tekton-pipelines.apps.green.ocp.csplab.local).
2. Click **PipelineRuns** in the left-nav menu and click **Create PipelineRun** from the upper-right of the page.
3. Enter the following parameters and click **Create**:
    * **Namespace:** Target namespace for application deployment target
    * **Pipeline:** `appsody-deploy-pipeline`
    * **PipelineResources > git-source:** `git-source-reefer-ml`
    * **Params > context:** `simulator`
    * **Service Account:** `reefer-simulator`
4. A new PipelineRun will be created. Click on the name of the running PipelineRun.
5. From here, you can monitor the live running logs of the pipeline, as well as see what is running from the command-line with Kubectl (`kubectl get pods`). Note that the pipeline is actually running in pods deployed to the target namespace!
