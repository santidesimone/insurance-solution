While the content of this repository is mostly technical in nature and is intended for a technical audience, it also introduces methodology practices, such as Design thinking, [Event Storming](), which would be used with business leaders to identify business process and key business domain events and actions. You may find it useful to share this information with your business leaders before engaging them in such innovative projects.

At a high level, this is what you should expect to learn by working through this and other related repositories:

* **As an architect,** you will understand how the event-driven architecture provides capabilities which support development of event-driven solutions to addess loosely coupling of the microservices and scale horizontally. You will understand how to inject complex stateful operation on data stream for real time processing, understand new modern pipeline to data lake to let scientists develop AI model to be deployed as service.
* **As a developer,** you will understand how to develop event-driven applications and develop real time analytics based on Kafka streams. Under how operational research model can be integrated into microservice to compute optimized shipment plan. 
* **As a data scientist,**, you will see how cloud Pak for data delivers powerful features to do feature engineering and develop models.
* **As a project manager,** you may understand all the artifacts which may be required for developing such innovative solution.

The related repositories provide sample code and best practices  which you may want to get inspiration for your future projects.
